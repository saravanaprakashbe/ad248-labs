❏ Question 1: EAP in Standalone and Domain Mode 
❏ Standalone Configuration ​ : ​ Take a fresh installation of EAP 7.0. Start two standalone servers on the same machine using the same default port(like http-8080, management 9990 etc). Server-1  does not require messaging and Server-2 requires clustering.
❏ Domain-Host configuration ​ : Create 3 controller, one Domain(name=master) and two host(host1 and host2). 
→ Both hosts use Domain Controller Discovery and Failover Configuration to connect to the Domain.
→ Domain controller does not have any server.
→ host1 has two servers, server1 and server2 belonging to host1-server-group.
→ host2 also contains two servers, server3 and server4 belonging to host2-server-group.
→ Only server1,2 and 3 starts, when corresponding host controller is started
→ server1, server2, server3 and server4 require both messaging and high availability.

❏ Question 2: CLI usage and Datasource configuration [Total Scores 5]
❏ Create a datasource for ​ MySQL ​ database with JNDI name ​ MySQLDS ​ via CLI in standalone mode and share the CLI command and set below attributes and share the CLI command to Monitoring Datasource statistics and the result as well.
❏ Prepared statement cache ->40
❏ Min-pool ->10
❏ Max-pool ->25

❏ Question 3: Messaging Subsystem 
❏ Configure activemq(artemis) to accept http connection, http connection
factory JNDI name=”jms/CF/RemoteConnectionFactory” and queue JNDI
name=”jms/queue/TestQueue” in domain mode.
❏ Make the required changes to “ server2 and server4” respectively from
“​ Domain-Host configuration ​ ” question from “​ Question 1: EAP in Standalone and Domain Mode​ ” above. 
→ Create two users: jmsadmin and jmsuser.
→ jmsadmin can send and consume messages from the queue.
→ jmsuser can only consume messages from the queue.







❏ Question 4: Logging Subsystem 
❏ Create a new handler such that it will rotate on hourly basis and it will log DEBUG level messages related to the “​ com.arjuna” ​ package only. Make the required changes to “Server-1 and Server-2” from “​ Standalone Configuration ​ ” question from “​ Question 1: EAP in Standalone and Domain Mode​ ” above. 

❏ In domain mode, configure the logging subsystem such that, for all servers of the main-server-group, the logs should be created at a custom location “/home/EAPLogs/MainServerGroup/” and for the other-server-group the logs should be at “/home/EAPLogs/OtherServerGroup/” . Make the required changes to the server nodes used in “​ Question 1: EAP in Standalone and Domain Mode​ ” from Domain-Host configuration question above. 

❏ Question 6: Undertow Subsystem 
Make the following changes to “Server-1 and Server-2” from “​ Standalone Configuration ​ ” question from “​ Question 1: EAP in Standalone and Domain Mode​ ” above.
❏ Set “max-connections” to 1024 for http listener and share the CLI command.
❏ Deploy an provided ”FirstWebApp.war” application to Jboss server and access it on context root as follows : ​ http://localhost:8080/​ 




Some more : 


1. Install EAP under the "/opt/ad248" folder. It should be like "opt/ad248/bin"
Username: webuser Password: secret1

2. Create new domain directory call "webserver" using the below command, 

cp -R /opt/ad248/Domain /opt/ad248/webserver

Start it with " ./domain.sh -Djboss .domain.base.dir=/opt/ad248/webserver"
 Access the management console.

03. Set the HTTP tuning parameters which includes the below changes,
﻿﻿﻿A. Set HTTP port to 8080
﻿﻿﻿B. Configure the AJP port
﻿﻿﻿C. Set the Max number of HTTP connection to 60

03. Set the JVM parameters at the Server Group level.
 Create a group call SimpleGroup and server instance call server1(the name could be different)

 A. Set the Max Heap as 1182M and Initial heap as 1182M
B. Set the Stack size as.256k 

/For server level:
/server-group=Group1/jvm=<give jvm name>:write-attribute(name=stack-size,value=256)
/server-group=Group1/jvm=<give jvm name>:write-attribute(name=heap-size,value=1182M)
/server-group=Group1/jvm=<give jvm name>:write-attribute(name=max-heap-size,,value=256)


If at host-controller level: 
/host=host3/jvm=default:write-attribute(name=stack-size,value=265)

04. Create Datasource as Test DB  as in Guided Ex: Configuring a Data Source (which has dependency on Configuring JDBC Drivers)

05. Configure an Non-XA Datasource as in GE:  Configuring an XA Datasource

06. Create a security Domain as in GE Securing an Application (page 403)

07. Set up a domain mode as below:
Host 1 → Master, Host2 → Slave
Server group names: Cluster and Message
Servers names :  CLusterS1, MessageS1 which runs on host1
Servers names : CLusterS2 ,messageS2 which runs on host2

08. Set up a cluster and change the previous setup of domain mode:
 Use full-ha profile for server-group → CLuster
Use Full profile for server-group---> Message 

JMS:
Create a connection Factory  and queue as in Guided exercise : Configuring Messaging Resources (page : 353)
Put tester role in security settings:  

		 	 	 		
			
				
For Example something like below:	
Apply a security setting on a Queue create before							
		
/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/security-setting=\
jms.topic.StockQuotes.#/role=Testerr:add(\
send=true,consume=true)

Q. create a Application  user named “clientjms”  with tester role.

09. Start the application root context as in “Demonstration: Setting the root web location” pg no 579
